# the_todo_app

A very simple todo app that doesn't work yet, because state is not being managed right.

Can be fixed by passing state around or using a state management library like `provider`.

This branch shows how to use Firebase / Firestore to store the todos.
In order to uses it, you need to connect it to an appropriate Firebase project.

This can be done by running `flutterfire configure --project=<project-name>`.
